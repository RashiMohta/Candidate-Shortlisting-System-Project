# Candidate-Shortlisting-System-Project
An attempt to simplify employee recruitment by filtering candidates based on their attitude and confidence. Online interviews will be conducted where the questions are promted on the screen and the recording of the answers given by the candidate will be assessed. Using the video, the identity of the interviewee will be verified; eye-blinking count will be calculated for different parts of the interview and compared to get an idea of his confidence while answering different questions; and eye ball rotation will be measured to identify cases of reading text directly from the screen. A transcript of the interview will be generated for further reference. This clubbed with automatic resume screening, stress detection through speech analysis and facial expression recognition and transcript analysis can improve the results greatly.
