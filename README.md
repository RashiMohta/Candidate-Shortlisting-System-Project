# Employee Recruitment Simplification System

This project aims to simplify the employee recruitment process by filtering candidates based on their attitude and confidence during online interviews. The system conducts interviews where questions are prompted on the screen, and the candidate's answers are recorded for assessment. The system utilizes various techniques to evaluate candidates, including identity verification, eye-blinking count analysis, and transcript generation.

## Features

### 1. Online Interviews
   - Questions are prompted on the screen.
   - Candidate's answers are recorded for evaluation.

### 2. Identity Verification
   - Facial recognition techniques can be integrated for identity verification.

### 3. Eye-Blinking Count Analysis
   - The system calculates the eye-blinking count during different parts of the interview to assess the candidate's confidence level.

### 4. Transcript Generation
   - Audio from the interview video is transcribed to generate a transcript for further reference.

## Future Developments

While the current version of the system provides basic functionality for online interviews and candidate evaluation, several enhancements could be implemented in the future:

### 1. Integration of Identity Verification
   - Implement facial recognition techniques for automated identity verification of candidates.

### 2. Eye Ball Rotation Measurement
   - Integrate eye ball rotation measurement to identify cases of candidates reading text directly from the screen.

### 3. Stress Detection and Facial Expression Recognition
   - Incorporate techniques for stress detection through speech analysis and facial expression recognition to assess candidate's emotional state during interviews.

### 4. Automatic Resume Screening
   - Develop functionality for automatic screening of candidate resumes to further streamline the recruitment process.
